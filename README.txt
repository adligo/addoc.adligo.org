This project is the basis for documenting a open source project,
while loading it up with adds which will provide a passive funding
model for something that is free.  I got this idea from vogella.com
while surfing for a solution to some typical software problem.  Then
I started noticing that MOST open source documentation has NO adds!

  This seems like a missed opportunity for most projects!  If your
code is getting used, people are probably reading the documentation,
why not get paid for it too while they read and surf!

This should remain a stand alone project with no dependencies
other than GWT.  GWT is great for i18n so you can add languages
with ease.
